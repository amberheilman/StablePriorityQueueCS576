The reports are included in the src folder. The following are provided:
	- Emma Coverage Report (along with image)
	- JUnit Tests Report
	- FindBugs Report
	
All of these reports were generated using an eclipse plugin or jar.
Using Eclipse:
	To run tests add JUnit jar to directory, add jar to Run Configurations, right click on project and Run As JUnit Test.
	To run emma add emma jar to directory, add jar to Run Configurations, right click on project and Coverage as selecting emma.
	To run FindBugs, install plugin, right click on project and FindBugs -> FindBugs.
		
		
Coverage report is less than 100 due to the requirement that emma requires a main function, but no tests are needed for this method.
FindBugs reported no issues.
All Tests are passing.
